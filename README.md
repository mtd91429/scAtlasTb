**Toolbox of Snakemake pipelines for easy-to-use analyses and benchmarks for building integrated atlases**

This toolbox provides multiple modules that can be easily combined into custom workflows that leverage the file management of [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/v7.31.1/).
This allows for an efficient and scalable way to run analyses on large datasets that can be easily configured by the user.

## Getting started

Please refer to the [documentation][].


## 🧰 Which Modules does the Toolbox Support?

The modules are located under `workflow/` and can be run independently or combined into a more complex workflow.

## 👀 TL;DR What does a full workflow look like?

The heart of the configuration is captured in a YAML (or JSON) configuration file.
Here is an example of a workflow configuration in `configs/example_config.yaml` containing the `preprocessing`, `integration` and `metrics` modules:

```yaml
output_dir: data/out
images: images

os: intel
use_gpu: true

DATASETS:

  my_dataset: # custom task/workflow name

    # input specification: map of module name to map of input file name to input file path
    input:
      preprocessing:
        file_1: data/pbmc68k.h5ad
        # file_2: ... # more files if required
      integration: preprocessing # all outputs of module will automatically be used as input
      metrics: integration
    
    # module configuration
    preprocessing:
      highly_variable_genes:
        n_top_genes: 2000
      pca:
        n_comps: 50
      assemble:
        - normalize
        - highly_variable_genes
        - pca
    
    # module configuration
    integration:
      raw_counts: raw/X
      norm_counts: X
      batch: batch
      methods:
        unintegrated:
        scanorama:
          batch_size: 100
        scvi:
          max_epochs: 10
          early_stopping: true

    # module configuration
    metrics:
      unintegrated: layers/norm_counts
      batch: batch
      label: bulk_labels
      metrics:
        - nmi
        - graph_connectivity
```

Which allows you to call the pipeline as follows:

```
snakemake --configfile configs/example_config.yaml --snakefile workflow/Snakefile --use-conda -nq
```

giving you the following dryrun output:

```

total                                     31

Reasons:
    (check individual jobs above for details)
    input files updated by another job:
        integration_all, integration_barplot_per_dataset, integration_benchmark_per_dataset, integration_compute_umap, integration_plot_umap, integration_postprocess, integration_prepare, integra[...]
    missing output files:
